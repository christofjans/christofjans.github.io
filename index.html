                        JwtAuthLib is a .NET library to help implement authentication for WebApi projects without using .Net Core identity. As the name implies it uses Jwt bearer tokens.

                        Recently, I had to convert a large number of Markdown files to PDF. Obviously, I wanted to automate this.

                        Recently, I was working on an application which logged information to the Console. The issue I ran into is that the logging information would not always show up in the console; sometimes it would, sometimes it wouldn't.

                        Suppose you are developing your application, merrily committing code when suddenly you realize that a bug has been introduced. You know for sure an earlier commit was correct but the last commit is not. The bug was introduced somewhere between these 2 commits, but where?

                        This is a test post of my new &quot;blog-engine&quot;. The world clearly does not have enough blog engines so I decided to write my own. It uses git, .NET Core and Markdown on the client and is hosted on GitHub.
